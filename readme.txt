My approach was to complete those task first which have higher score but after 2 and 
a half day learning and implementing Hubl form, hubl drag and drop, successfully creating 
macro and implementing it to code and doing other small things i am submitting the task
because i do not have time. I am an internee and working on creating magento pwa studio 
extensions and do not have so much time to try and implement new things and then troubleshooting.
